The first involves comparing the sizes of letters by equating expressions such as 0.5*a to other expressions. The second scenario is where all given alphabetic formulas are equal to 1 and the problem asks to find the values in another expression involving these letters using addition or subtraction.

The user's question falls directly in line with the second situation mentioned in the provided knowledge. The expressions given, 0.75 * x = 1 and 0.25 * y = 1, demonstrate each alphabetic formula equating to 1.

1. Knowledge specifies learning to use reciprocals to solve problems related to alphabetic formulas, specifically where a letter (variable) is multiplied by a number, evident in forms like 0.5*a.

2. The knowledge discusses:
   - Comparing the sizes of letters, given an equation linking alphabetic formulas.

If a jar is filled with 10 marbles and 3/10 are blue while 2/5 are red, which color has more marbles?	0	1	"The given question involves comparing the fractions 3/10 and 2/5 to determine which is greater, therefore revealing which color (blue or red) has more marbles. The question basically requires comparing two proper fractions concerning their values. However, the denominators of the fractions are not the same (10 for blue, and 5 for red), which is a crucial deviation from the topic, as it requires comparing fractions with different denominators rather than those with the same denominator as specified in the knowledge criteria.

Furthermore, solving this question might involve converting these fractions to have a common denominator for direct comparison, which involves using arithmetic operations like multiplication. Such calculations are explicitly stated to be avoided in the knowledge description.

Thus, the question does not meet the criteria outlined in the knowledge as both the denominators are different and potentially involves arithmetic calculations to compare the sizes of the fractions.

After \frac{2}{3} becomes \frac{8}{12}, the original fraction is enlarged by 4 times. ____ (judge whether it is true or false) Reason: ____.	1	1	"The question presented asks for the verification and explanation of whether the original fraction \(\frac{2}{3}\) becomes \(\frac{8}{12}\) by being enlarged by 4 times. To analyze this, we should understand how fractions are scaled or modified.

The transformation from \(\frac{2}{3}\) to \(\frac{8}{12}\) can be checked by simplifying \(\frac{8}{12}\). Simplifying  \(\frac{8}{12}\) by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 4 (the greatest common divisor), we get \(\frac{2}{3}\). This shows that \(\frac{8}{12}\) is equivalent to \(\frac{2}{3}\).

This scaling can be identified by comparing the numerators (2 and 8) and the denominators (3 and 12). Both the numerator and the denominator were multiplied by the same factor, 4:

- Numerator scaling: \(2 \times 4 = 8\)
- Denominator scaling: \(3 \times 4 = 12\)

Therefore, \(\frac{2}{3}\) is transformed into \(\frac{8}{12}\) by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by 4. This confirms that the original fraction \(\frac{2}{3}\) is indeed enlarged by 4 times in terms of its representation as \(\frac{8}{12}\).

This part aligns with the Knowledge description, as it concerns the rewriting of a number (an integer in this case) into a decimal format while still representing the same value.

The knowledge in question is specifically aimed at understanding and identifying common multiples of two or three numbers among 2, 3, and 5, either through choosing such multiples from a list or determining the smallest or largest common multiple from given choices. In contrast, the question exclusively addresses the property of a number being a multiple of 5 without consideration of the numbers 2 or 3.

A cyclist rides at a speed of 20 km/h for 3 hours before taking a 15-minute rest. What distance can they cover in a total travel time of 4.5 hours?	1	1	"The <Question> asks about calculating the travel distance for a cyclist given specific cycling and rest intervals. The question involves determining the total distance covered by the cyclist in a specified travel time, considering both moving and resting periods.

This scenario described in the <Question> reflects the type of knowledge described in <Knowledge>, which involves calculations based on activity intervals (walking or cycling in this example) and rest intervals. However, the specific elements mentioned in the <Knowledge> (calculation of travel time and distance focusing primarily on walking and rest intervals) do not perfectly match those of the question, where the activity is cycling. The fundamental principle of calculating time and distance involving periods of activity and rest is consistent with what's mentioned in the <Knowledge>, which generalizes to any form of travel with rests, although the precise specifics (walking) are not a perfect match.

As such, while there is a difference in the mode of the activity (walking versus cycling), the underlying principle of calculating based on travel and rest timings aligns closely. Therefore, the <Question> indeed concerns the <Knowledge>, as it inquires about calculating total distances with the incorporation of rest periods, just as outlined in <Knowledge>.
